import deepimpact as di
import math
#### General idea: Will receive variables, needs to take them, 

### RECEIVE DATA FROM API HERE ###


### ACTUAL CALCULATION PART ###
### The Catalyst: Deep Impact requires 8 parameters: Radius (meters), Angle (Degrees), Strength (Pascals [Kg/(m*s^2)]), Density (Kg/m^3),
### Latitude, Longitude, and Bearing [the last three only affect meteor trajectory].

# We start by taking API data and converting it into units fit for Deep-Impact
radius = diameter*500 #API measures Diameter in km

volume = (4/3)*(math.pi)*radius^3

strength = megatons*4.184e15*(1/volume)

density = mass/volume

#### the UI first reads the numbers input
#### into Radius, Angle, Strength, Density, Velocity.
#### Then it saves a calculation from earth.solve_atmospheric entry.
#### So basically, we have everything we can get. 
#### We just need a thing that says "if user clicks on NEO from the dropdown,
#### then populate the respective UI entries based on the formulas above."
